# Fake_News_Detection
The Project aims to tackle one of the most pressing challenges in the digital era- the rapid spread of fake or machine-generated news that influences public opinion, manipulates decisions, and undermines trust in media.
# Overview
The project aims to identify and classify misleading or false news articles using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. It employs a hybrid approach combining transformer-based deep learning models such as BERT and GPT-2 with a classical Random Forest model trained on TF-IDF and GLTR features. The system processes and analyzes textual data to determine the authenticity of news as real or fake. It is deployed using FastAPI for backend services and Streamlit for the user interface, containerized with Docker for scalability, portability, and efficient model serving.
# Models Used for Training
The project utilizes three models for training — BERT, GPT-2, and Random Forest — each contributing unique strengths. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), an encoder-based model, captures contextual word relationships for accurate text understanding. GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2), a decoder-based model, excels at identifying linguistic patterns and generative characteristics in fake content. Random Forest, a classical machine learning ensemble model, is trained on TF-IDF and GLTR features to capture statistical and stylometric cues in news articles. Together, these models create a robust hybrid framework for detecting fake news with high accuracy and interpretability.
# Findings and Results
The Project achieved highly promising results across all models. The BERT model attained an accuracy of 98%, showcasing strong contextual understanding of text. The GPT-2 model slightly outperformed it with 99% accuracy, effectively capturing linguistic patterns typical of fake or machine-generated content. The Random Forest model, trained on TF-IDF and GLTR features, achieved 96% accuracy, demonstrating that classical models still perform competitively with engineered features. These results indicate that transformer-based architectures significantly enhance detection reliability, while the hybrid approach combining deep learning and traditional methods ensures a balanced trade-off between performance and interpretability.
# Future Scope of the project
The Future Scope of the project lies in enhancing its scalability, adaptability, and real-world applicability. Future improvements can include integrating multilingual support to detect fake news across diverse languages and regional contexts. Incorporating real-time data streams from social media and news platforms will enable dynamic and continuous detection. The use of explainable AI (XAI) can improve transparency in model decisions. Additionally, implementing adversarial training will help counter evolving fake news generation techniques. Finally, deploying the system on cloud platforms with API-based access can make it a practical, scalable solution for media organizations and fact-checking agencies.
